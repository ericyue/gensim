doc2vec in gensim â€“ support pretrained word2vec
==================================

The default doc2vec model in Gensim does't support pretrained word2vec model. But according to Jey Han Lau and Timothy Baldwin's paper, [An Empirical Evaluation of doc2vec with Practical Insights into Document Embedding Generation(2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05368), using pretrained word2vec model usually gets better results in NLP tasks. The author also released a [forked Gensim verstion](https://github.com/jhlau/gensim) to perform pretrained embeddings, but it is from a very old Gensim version, which can't be used in Gensim 3.8(which is the latest Gensim version when I release this fork).
